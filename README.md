## Features

- Pengwin is a Linux environment for Windows 10 built on open-source technology conceived by Microsoft Research and the Linux ecosystem curated by the Debian project.
- Pengwin is also the first Linux distribution pre-configured and optimized to run specifically on [Windows® Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-WSL), a Microsoft-supported feature of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.
- Pengwin includes [wslu](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu), a set of useful open-source utilities for interacting between WSL and Windows 10.
- A custom Pengwin-setup tool, accessible via `$ pengwin-setup` allows new Pengwin users to get started on Linux immediately:
    - Change language and keyboard settings.
    - Select optional shells: csh, zsh (with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)), and [fish](https://fishshell.com/) (with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)).
    - Choose text editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [neovim](https://neovim.io/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    - Unpack your favorite development environment [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (with n, npm, and/or yarn), Python 3.7 (with pip), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) (via rbenv), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (via rustup installer) and [Go](https://golang.org/).
    - Manage your Microsoft Windows and Azure deployments with [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and [azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli), command line tools for Azure.
    - Enable/disable Windows Explorer shell integration.
    - Configure experimental GUI settings, including a [Windows 10 theme](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10) for your Linux applications, HiDPI support and international input methods.
    - Create a secure bridge to Docker running on Windows.
- Support for [many Linux graphical applications](https://github.com/ethanhs/WSL-Programs) with no need to configure display or libGL in Pengwin. (Requires a Windows-based X server, such as [X410](http://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/1291904/459838/7593?prodsku=9NLP712ZMN9Q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fp%2Fx410%2F9NLP712ZMN9Q).)
- Install over 27,790 open source packages via the apt package management system from the [expansive Debian repositories](https://packages.debian.org/testing/) and any third-party Debian-compatible repositories from outside projects.
- Pengwin provides faster patching for WSL-specific bugs than any upstream Linux distro available on WSL.
- New features are [actively developed](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin/pulls) based on [community input](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin/issues). Learn how you can [earn paid grants](CONTRIBUTING.md) improving Pengwin.

The third build uploaded during 1.2.x window will be marked 1.2.3.

To check your version of pengwin-setup: `$ apt-cache policy pengwin-setup`

To check your verison of pengwin-base: `$ apt-cache policy pengwin-base`

## Obtaining Support

Purchases of Pengwin in the Microsoft Store pay for a team of open source indie developers to add new features, test and release builds, evaluate WSL-related CVEs, and provide user support. User support is provided on a best effort basis. Most issues can be resolved by following the steps below. 

- First, search for your issue on the Pengwin Issues page [here](https://github.com/whitewaterfoundry/Pengwin/issues).
- Next, search for your issue on the general WSL Issues page [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues).
- Then consult the official [Troubleshooting Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting) documentation from Microsoft.
- Finally, if you are still unable to resolve your issue, please submit a bug report [here](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and we will do our best to help you. We usually respond to most Issues within a few hours. Thank you for your patience.
